# The-Jerry-Filter-
Path of Exile 2 loot filter with Jelly Hoshiumi SFX

Instructions:
1) Go to C:\Users\Whateveryourusername\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2
2) Extract the contents to that folder

While In-game go to Options -> Game, and where it says item filter, click the jelly filter. If you're doing it mid game and it won't show, click the reload button next to the drop down list. If that's not showing click the folder button and manually pick the file.

Until Neversink gets an actual filter editor going, the best you're going to have in terms of editing these are just downloading a filter that looks nice and replacing the sounds yourself. Honestly its too much of a hassle to update minute things this early in the beta, especially since Neversink's going to program it anyway.
If you have sounds you want added or replaced to the filter, open it in notepad (preferably notepad++) and ctrl+f the sound you want changed. Change the file name to the sound you want.
EX) For sounds including "Jerry_18.mp3" replace everything in quotes to the filename of the sound you want to use, e.g. Jerry_7.mp3 or Jerry_10.mp3 or whatever you want.
This goes for most filters coming out since they'll most likely be based around Neversinks filter anyway.

I don't think the filetype matters, but just case, use MP3.

PS) Do whatever you want the filter and sounds, it doesn't really matter.

PSS) The bonus sounds are just that, mix and match have fun.
